# netflix-gamepad

A Chrome extension for controlling Netflix playback with a USB gamepad.

This extension was written in under an hour and breaks every coding convention. Use at your own risk!

This is dependent on Netflix's JS API, so can break at any time. Should probably fire keyboard events or something more universal but we'll sort this problem when it becomes a problem!
